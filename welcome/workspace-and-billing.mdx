Workspaces lets you build apps collaboratively.

With Workspaces, you are able to invite team members to collaborate on apps together.

## Setting Up a Workspace

To create a Workspace, click the `Create Workspace` button under the "**MY WORKSPACES**" menu on the Dashboard

As a Workspace owner, you can create apps by clicking `Create Project` and [Invite](/docs/workspace-and-billing#inviting-collaborators)
 collaborators, and change [Workspace Settings](/docs/workspace-and-billing#settings)
.

## Workspace Settings

You can access Workspace Settings by clicking the gear icon on the right side of your workspace's name.

### Settings

Change the Workspace Name and Icon on this page. Additionally, you can permanently delete the entire workspace. After clicking `Delete Workspace`, you will be asked to confirm its deletion.

### Collaborators

Invite new workspace collaborators and view the list of existing collaborators. To remove a collaborator, click the **Trash** icon and click `Remove Collaborator`.

## Inviting Collaborators

Click the `Invite` button on the top right of the Collaborators screen under the Workspace, you'd like to invite a Collaborator(s) to.

Once clicked, a modal will appear for you to enter the email of the teammate you'd like to add. You can also remove existing collaborators in this modal by clicking the `Trash` icon next to their names.

New collaborators will receive an email invitation to join your Workspace. Once they accept the invitation to join, their status will change from `Invited` to `Collaborator` in your Workspace.

> ## ðŸ“˜Please Note: Please check your Draftbit plan for Eligibility and number of collaborators allowed to be invited.
