Welcome! There's a lot you can accomplish inside of Draftbit and there's also a lot to learn about it. Our documentation, guides, and team are all here to help you as you build your app. Let's get started.

## Before you Build

**Get acquainted with the Dashboard**  
Check out the Dashboard [Overview page](/docs/dashboard)
 to get yourself familiarized with Draftbit's Dashboard interface.

**Make sure you have Live Preview app on your phone**  
The in-browser Web Preview is a great way to get an idea of what your app looks like but Live Preview app will give you the most accurate look (and several features/components require it). For more guidance on getting set up, make sure to check out the [Live Preview](/docs/live-preview)
 doc.

**Join the Community**

## Start Building!

**Get acquainted with the Builder**  
Take a look at the [Introduction to the Builder](/docs/introduction-to-the-builder)
 article to familiarize yourself with the main sections of the Builder and learn more about what you can do inside of Draftbit.

**Learn about Flexbox**  
Using Flexbox is important in creating the perfect, responsive layout for your app. If you're not familiar with Flexbox, be sure to read up on all the different properties in the [Layout](/docs/layout)
 article.

**Learn what you can do with Components**  
In the pages under the [Components](/docs/intro-to-components)
 section, you can read about all the different ways you can add and customize your components (and [even create your own](/docs/custom-blocks)
).

**Add advanced functionality**  
Once your UI is built, you can connect your screens with [Navigation](/docs/intro-to-navigation)
 and add a [Data](/docs/fetching-data)
 source to your app. Reference the [Integrations](/docs/rest-api-integrations)
 page for instructions on setting up specific APIs. To enable experiences Expo/React Native supports but Draftbit doesn't quite yet, try out our [Custom Code](/docs/custom-screen-code)
 features
