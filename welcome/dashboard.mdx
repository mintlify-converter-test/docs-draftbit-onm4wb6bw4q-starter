## Workspaces

Workspaces allow you to group apps together and invite other users to work collaboratively on those projects. Workspaces are only available on certain subscription plans.

## Starter Apps

If you're looking to kickstart a new app project, Starter Apps are a great resource. These are pre-built apps that contain many screens with various layouts that are ready for you to customize with your own colors, branding, and styles. Most Screens that available in our Starter Apps are also available to add individually to an existing app as Example Screens.

## Example Screens

Here is where you can preview Example Screens and add them directly to one of your apps. These Example Screens can also be accessed inside of the Builder. To access any of these, click the **\+ (plus)** button next to **Screens** panel.
