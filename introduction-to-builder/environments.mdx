## Environment Values

In some places where values are set in Draftbit, like a [REST API Service's](/docs/rest-api-services)
 base URL or [App](/docs/app-variables)
 and [Device](/docs/device-variables)
 Variables, you can specify different values for Development (Dev) and Production (Prod) Environments.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Development Values** | Development values are used when no Production value is set and when you have selected **Dev** as the publishing or previewing environment. |
| **Production Values** | Production values will be used when publishing and previewing in the **Prod** environment. If unset the Development value will be used. |

## Previewing Environment

When [previewing](/docs/live-preview)
 your app in Web, iOS, and Android, you can choose which environment values to use. You can select the preview environment using the environment selector in the [top bar of the Builder](/docs/introduction-to-the-builder#top-bar)
.

**Draft view always uses the Dev environment**.

## Publishing Environment

When [publishing](/docs/publishing)
 your app to Web, iOS, or Android, you can choose which environment values to use. You can select the publishing environment using the environment selector from the Publish menu in the [top bar of the Builder](/docs/introduction-to-the-builder#top-bar)
.
