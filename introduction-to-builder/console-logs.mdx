Similar to the browser console, Draftbit's Console Log let's you see errors and log data during development. It's used as a debugging tool and will display logs for the embedded [previews](/docs/live-preview)
 as well as when previewing on a physical device.

You can pass values, such as the result of an [Action](/docs/assigning-actions)
 or a [Variable](/docs/variables)
, and it will be printed to the console log. The console logs are located in the [bottom drawer of the Builder](/docs/introduction-to-the-builder#bottom-drawer)
. Any errors resulting from your [Custom Code](/docs/custom-code-component)
 or [Imported Packages](/docs/custom-packages)
 will also be logged here.

> ## ⚠️Not available in Draft Preview
> 
> Console Logs are only viewable when your Draftbit app is being previewed using [Web, iOS, and Android previews](/docs/live-preview)
> .

> ## ❗️Remove any console logs before publishing your app
> 
> Make sure to remove any `console.log()` statements in your app's [Custom Code](/docs/custom-code-component)
> , and remove or disable any [Console Log Actions](/docs/assigning-actions)
> , when you are preparing to publish your app.
> 
> These statements can cause performance and security issues in your production app. [Reference](https://reactnative.dev/docs/performance#using-consolelog-statements)
> .

## Using Log to Console Action

You can log any data you need to the console using the [Log to Console Action](/docs/assigning-actions#log-to-console)
. The results of the Log to Console action are shown in the **Console Logs** tab in the [bottom drawer of the Builder](/docs/introduction-to-the-builder#bottom-drawer)
.

## Console Log statements in Custom Code

You can use a `console.log()` statement in your [Functions](/docs/custom-functions)
 or [Files](/docs/custom-files)
 to see them logged in the **Console Logs** tab in the bottom drawer of the Builder.

In the example below, there is a Custom Code Component defined as follows:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Text } from 'react-native';

export const MyComponent = () => {
  console.log('Console statement inside Custom Code Component triggered!');

  return <Text>Hello world!</Text>;
};

```
