>  on an Icon to make it interactive, use the [Icon Button](/docs/buttons#icon-button)
>  component instead.

## Style Properties

Style properties allow you to customize the look and feel of the component. Combinations of styles applied to components can be saved as [Stylesheets](/docs/stylesheets)
